1.	a) Design, Develop and Implement a Java program to calculate gross salary net salary taking the following data

DA=40% of basic
HRA=20% of basic
CCA=Rs250/-
PF=10%of basic
PT=Rs100/-
Income tax = 10% of gross

Gross income: Basic + DA + HRA + CCA
Deductions = PF+PT+IT
Net income = Gross income â€“ Deductions
import java.util.Scanner;
public class EmployeeSalary {
	
	public static void main(String[] args) {
		
		String name,id;
		double bSalary, DA, HRA, PF, IT,grossIncome, netIncome, deductions;
		double CCA = 250, PT = 100;
		
		Scanner s = new Scanner(System.in);
		System.out.println("Enter name of the employee");
		name = s.nextLine();
		System.out.println("Enter Employee ID");
		id = s.nextLine();
		System.out.println("Enter basic salary");
		bSalary = s.nextDouble();
		
		DA = (0.4)*bSalary;
		HRA = (0.2)*bSalary;
		PF = (0.1)*bSalary;
		
		grossIncome = bSalary + DA + HRA+CCA;
		IT = (0.1)*grossIncome;
		deductions = PF+PT+IT;
		netIncome = grossIncome - deductions;
	
System.out.println("The Gross income of employee "+name+" with ID "+id+" is "+grossIncome);
System.out.println("The Net income of employee "+name+" with ID "+id+" is "+netIncome);
		s.close();	

	}

}
